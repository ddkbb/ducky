# ducky
scripting language for flipper zero

This script was to iterate through file:///A:/ to file:///Z:/ drives in order to eventually open the CD-ROM drive (if there is one).
This is to simulate a brute force cupholder opener.
I used a python script to create the ducky script, which iterates through the alphabet and spits out a script for each drive with differing letters.
